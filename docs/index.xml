      <description>We believe broadband access should be treated as shared infrastructure. Every person should have affordable easy access to connectivity.
This will only be possible if communities are able to self start on their broadband discovery journey.
After many years building broadband network planning software and completing designs for 10&amp;rsquo;s of millions of homes for the industry the founders of broadband.cat came together to enable anyone to use open source software and open data to detemine the cost of a network for their region.</description>
